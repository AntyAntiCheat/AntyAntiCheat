                                          Anty AntiCheat | Version 2.0

Why another anticheat?

I have created this resource because I was tired of seeing overpriced and non-functional anticheats that (most of the times) were just copies of another anticheat projects. This is not the case, I have tested this resource on a live server with over 120 people and ~95%* of detections were right!

This resource is not a one time release like most of other anticheats. I am not planning on releasing this, earn some money and then abandon it. I will keep it updated as long as I can and as long as there are things that needs updates!


Deferral Cards support - Finally a beautiful deferral cards support
Improved No-Clip detections - Every type of no-clip is now detected, so far no false positives!
Magic Bullet detection - No more players shooting through objects!

Optimization - Anty AntiCheat is highly optimized and uses a maximum of 0.02ms on resmon! (This value depends on the number of players and/or your server hardware)
On-screen menu detection (OCR) - Detects suspicious text on the player's screen, such as mod menus)
A wide range of console commands - Commands for banning, unbanning, updating or even deleting vehicles/objects/pedals are indispensable to any anticheat! And Anty AntiCheat is no exception!
